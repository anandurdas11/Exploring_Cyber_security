### Scanning the machine with nmap # 
> For scanning the machine we use the command `nmap -sV <ip> `

> We can see that there many services let's take any two and  try to exploit it.

> First go with vsftpd 2.3.4 lets search in metasploit database using the `search command`

> So there is exploit for this lets select that exploit

> We have selected the payload let see the options

> We have to set the rhosts with is the target host

> So when run the exploit we where able to get a root shell

> There something running on port 445 and 139 let's search

> So we able to find out that samba  services are  running on 445 and  139 let's try searching samba in metasploit.


> Lets use the 8 usermap script on this machine and try to gain the root acess.

> Rhosts is set and we exploit

> After the running exploit we get a root shell

> So we can see that we are in the target machine a we have full acess

# Windows 10 machine #

> This the target windows machine

> Let's try get access to that machine using a reverse shell when get executed in the windows machine will give reverse connection to attacker machine.

> So we created the payload with the help of msfvenom now we will deliever to windows machine and start the listener in the kali machine

> So we downloaded file target machine let's setup the listener

> We use exploit multi hander to interact with payload

> We have to set the LHOST that is the ip of the attacker machine

> When we run the exploit it's waiting for the incoming connection

> We run the payload.exe file

> We got a reverse connection and it's the windows machine

> This shell provides many options lets try screenshare which allow us to monitor whatever the vicitim does

> We are able to see what the windows user does lets send keystroke saying you are hacked

> We have full control over the windows system
