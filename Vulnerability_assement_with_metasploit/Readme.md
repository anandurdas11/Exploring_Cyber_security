### Scanning the machine with nmap # 
> For scanning the machine we use the command `nmap -sV <ip> `

> We can see that there many services let's take any two and  try to exploit it.

> First go with vsftpd 2.3.4 lets search in metasploit database using the `search command`

> So there is exploit for this lets select that exploit

> We have to set the rhosts with is the target host

> So when run the exploit we where able to get a root shell

> There something running on port 445 and 139 let's search

> So we able to find out that samba  services are  running on 445 and  139 let's try searching samba in metasploit.

> Lets use the 8 usermap script on this machine and try to gain the root acess.

> So we can see that we are in the target machine a we have full acess
