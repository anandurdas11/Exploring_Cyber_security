# Learn the basic working of Wi-Fi and its types with various types of attacks on it.

## Basic Working of WiFi

Radio Signals: WiFi works by transmitting data over radio waves. Devices communicate in the WiFi network by sending and receiving radio signals.

Access Points (APs) act as the central hub for WiFi connections. They receive data from connected devices and transmit it to other devices on the network.

Network Identification: WiFi networks are identified by their Service Set IDentifier (SSID) which in simple terms is the network name.

Authentication and Encryption: When a device connects to a WiFi network, it undergoes an authentication process to verify its identity. WiFi protocols such as WPA2 or WPA3 are used to secure data transmissions over the network.

# Types of WiFi

802.11 b/g/n: These are older WiFi standards operating primarily in the 2.4 GHz frequency band. They offer relatively slower speeds compared to newer standards.

802.11 ac: Also known as WiFi 5, this standard operates in both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, providing faster speeds and improved performance compared to older standards.

802.11 ax: Also referred to as WiFi 6, this is the latest WiFi standard offering even higher speeds, lower latency, and improved efficiency, especially in high-density environments.

# Types of WiFi Attacks

Eavesdropping (Passive Attacks): Attackers can intercept WiFi signals to capture sensitive information such as passwords or financial data without actively engaging with the network.

Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks: In this type of attack, the attacker intercepts communication between two parties, potentially altering or eavesdropping on the data being transmitted.

Brute Force Attacks: Attackers attempt to crack WiFi passwords by systematically trying all possible combinations until they find the correct one.

Evil Twin Attacks: Attackers set up rogue access points with the same SSID as a legitimate network, tricking users into connecting to it and potentially exposing their data.

Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks: Attackers flood a WiFi network with an overwhelming amount of traffic, causing it to become unavailable to legitimate users.

WPS Vulnerabilities: WiFi Protected Setup (WPS) is a feature that simplifies the process of connecting devices to a WiFi network, but it can also introduce security vulnerabilities if not properly configured, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access.
